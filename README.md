# GU-DSL
The GU-DSL basic CBSE system

GU-DSL is a generic, dataflow driven domain specific language allowing to shorten the time-to-market
and improving the development process. Therefor we use some base concepts of Java and C#, adopting the 
idea of encapsulating classes and flow-models using diagrams as e.g. done by UML, but in a textual form. 
Giving developers the freedom of individual modeling, the DSL forces the developer, to adhere to special
structures and requirements using flow modeling which helps reducing recurring mistakes.

This repository contains the main parts of the underlying CBSE (component based software engineering) system.
